Simple, movable  and scalable triangle by using vertex shader and translation operations.

The biggest challenge was setting up os x environment to work with modernopengl framework.

I use:
 - glfw
 - glad
 - opengl

There is some os x specific settings in the code which I believe could help anyone wants to implement opengl with os x.

NOTE: Build script uses hardcoded path which you need to chage it.
